# Solve hCaptcha

**Solve hCaptcha** is a Python port of [JimmyLaurent/hcaptcha-solver](https://github.com/JimmyLaurent/hcaptcha-solver/).

Also consists of the port of hCaptcha's [hsl.js](https://assets.hcaptcha.com/c/b147199/hsl.js) to effectively avoid any JS evaluation or 
calls to fetch the file itself.
